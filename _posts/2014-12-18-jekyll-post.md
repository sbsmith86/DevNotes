So I figured it was about time for me to start a little blog. I just want a place to start gathering things I learn and documenting new discoveries. A new year is coming and I am going to dedicate myself to writing more code. 

And so, in keeping with the spirit of learning new things, I decided to try out using Jekyll to serve this blog. I've half-started blogs before. Sometimes using Drupal, other times using Wordpress. I always find them incredibly clunky for what I need to do with the blog. Do I really need to be setting up an entire CMS when all I want to do is write some words and maybe add an image or two? Ok ok, maybe a code snippet here and there. Hell, maybe I'll get crazy and want to embed a video. A CMS just seems to heavy for all that.

When I found out about Jekyll at work I was immediately intriuged. A simple static site to just quickly serve up pages is exactly what I need. I started setting up this blog around 9pm and one hour later I am pretty much up and running. 

I love how easy it is to configure and the templating seems pretty awesome to. I'll be digging more into that next.
